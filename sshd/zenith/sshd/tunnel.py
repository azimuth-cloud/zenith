    """
    This function is called when a user connects over SSH, and is responsible for
    registering the mapping of a subdomain to the port for a reverse SSH tunnel
    with Consul.

    The subdomain is determined by the SSH public key that the client connected with.

    The client specifies the bound port, and other tunnel configuration, using stdin.

    We would prefer to detect the bound port for the tunnel on this side but
    doing this reliably might be impossible, and is certainly very difficult
    and probably requires root.

    To get round this, the client reads the tunnel's dynamically-allocated port
    from stderr and pushes it back via stdin along with other configuration.

    This obviously places a lot of trust in a client to specify the SSH
    connection correctly, and also to specify the actual port it was allocated
    rather than a different port that another service may be connected to.

    We mitigate against this in a number of ways:

      1. Only allow the execution of this script over the SSH connection. This
         limits the ability of a nefarious client to collect information about
         other tunnels connected to the system and their ports.

      2. Encourage clients to use dynamically-allocated ports. This makes the
         port for a service more difficult to guess and so harder to connect
         to for nefarious purposes.

      3. Subdomains are bound to pre-registered SSH keys. A client can only connect
         to SSHD using a pre-registered SSH key, and the subdomain they can use
         is bound to that SSH key. The public key(s) for a subdomain are bound
         using a single-use token that is issued by the Zenith registrar. This
         prevents a potentially malicious client from connecting at all unless
         they have an SSH key bound to a domain, and prevents them from binding to
         a domain other than the one they were allocated.

      3. Only allow reverse port-forwarding, not regular port-forwarding. This
         prevents a nefarious client from setting up a regular port-foward to
         the bound port for another service and sending traffic directly to it,
         bypassing the proxy and any associated authentication.

      5. Only allow a domain to be bound to a port that is listening. This
         prevents a nefarious client from binding their domain to a port that
         is not yet in use in the hope of intercepting traffic in the future.

      6. Only allow one domain to be bound to each port. This prevents a nefarious
         client from binding their subdomain to an existing tunnel in order to
         intercept traffic.
